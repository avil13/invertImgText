jImgText
========

jQuery plugin - diff text color

This plugin inverts the color of the text by taking the background image


```JS
// get background image on this block
$('.patt-container').jIimgText();
```

or

```JS
$('.patt-container').jIimgText('/path/to/img.jpg');
```


Text color in ```.patt-container ``` block will be changed
